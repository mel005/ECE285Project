# ECE285Project


Description
===========
This is project Style Transfer is accomplished by Hailong Zeng, Menglai Li, Jiawei Qin, and Zhetao Gu as a final project for ECE285 at UCSD.

Requirements
============
Custom python module: image_tool.py, nntools,py



Code organization
=================
demo.ipynb        --  Run a demo of our code (reproduces Figure 3 of our report)
train.ipynb       --  Run the training of our model (as described in Section 2)
DnCNN.pth.tar     --  Trained model for DnCNN
UNet.pth.tar      --  Trained model for UNet
datasets1         --  Containing validation datasets for CycleGan mountain for content, style for style
datasets2         --  Containing validation datasets for Neural Style Transfer





This page contains the ECE285 project accomplished by Hailong Zeng, Menglai Li, Jiawei Qin, and Zhetao Gu. It contains several files, including a jupyter notebook file to rerun the training(include all necessary code), a jupyter notebook file for demonstration, some supplmentary custom python module, training and validation data, and trained model for evaluation.
